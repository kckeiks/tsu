Unicode Converter is a command line tool, implemented using ![Cobra](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra), that converts between strings, UTF-8 encoded code points and Unicode code point literals. 

# Motivation
I did not like most tools online as they tend to be slower and restricted in terms of features.
