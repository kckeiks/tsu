Unicode Converter is a command line tool, implemented using ![Cobra](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra), that converts between strings, UTF-8 encoded code points and Unicode code point literals. 

# Motivation
I found most tool online to be restricted in terms of features and full of ads. This tool is easy to use.
